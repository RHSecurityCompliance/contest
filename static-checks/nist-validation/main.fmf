summary: Check content with NIST SCAP Content Validation Tool.
test: python3 -m lib.runtest ./test.py
result: custom
environment+:
    PYTHONPATH: ../..
duration: 15m
require+:
  # we use java-17 specifically here because the NIST tool needs it and does not
  # work with any newer version
  - java-17-openjdk
adjust:
  - when: arch != x86_64
    enabled: false
    because: the test is not architecture-specific, one is enough
  - when: distro == rhel-10
    enabled: false
    because: TODO - RHEL-10 doesn't have Java 17, see requires above
